## About The Project

![StuckWin game](http://info.iut-bm.univ-fcomte.fr/staff/perrot/DUT-INFO/S1/SAE/SAE101102/_images/numPos.png)

__The Stuck Win project is the SAE1.01 & SAE1.02 project of the BUT informatique S1 department IUT Belfort Monbeillard.__

Stuckwin is a game for two players with the following simple rules:
- the game board, reproduced above, has 37 hexagonal slots, or squares, spread over a hexagonal board,
- the game has 13 blue chips and 13 red chips, all identical,
- one player has the blue chips, the other the red ones,
- the blue ones start the game,
- each player in turn moves a token to a free space immediately in front of him. A token has a maximum of three possible destinations. For example: at the beginning of the game, the blue chip in E3 can only be moved to D3, D4 or E4.
- a token cannot skip one or more other tokens,
- If, when it is his turn, a player has no more possibilities to move his chips, he wins the game,

### Travail demander SAE0.1
